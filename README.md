# Firefighting Robot Using Arduino ðŸš’ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview

The **Firefighting Robot** is an innovative prototype designed to detect and extinguish small fires autonomously. Built using Arduino, flame sensors, and a water tank system, this robot demonstrates the potential for low-cost, efficient fire management solutions in various environments.

## Features
- **Fire Detection**: Utilizes flame sensors to detect small fires.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Moves towards the fire source independently.
- **Water Tank Extinguishing System**: Sprays water to suppress the fire.
- **Affordable Components**: Uses easily accessible and cost-effective parts.

## Objectives
1. Early fire detection and suppression.
2. Reducing human risk in hazardous environments.
3. Providing a scalable solution for larger fire management systems.
4. Encouraging innovation in safety technology.
